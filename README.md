# Xplore
Xplore App - Ola API Hackathon

Here is the project concept about Xplore

Problem Statement: 

Lack of a unified experience - The experience which right now is missing from quickly getting there when we read or search about our favorite places or book tickets for our favorite movies. The missing experience when we read about something in Wikipedia, find the contact details in just dial and then book a cab separately. We believe all these and many more such things are not several different but is a single unified experience!
And we also believe that unifying is not just adding them all together but gives a scope to create many new and amazing possibilities.
 
Solution:  

Xplore! is our solution to the above problem. Xplore lets you explore places, things and beyond by either just typing in what you feel like looking for or browsing through many preexisting categories to find your favorite places, things etc. Whether it's about reading movie reviews or searching for that exclusive and rare thing that might located somewhere remote, we just not let you do that but help you quickly get there. What reliable partner could we have in this endeavor than Ola!. Xplore thus just not creates that refreshingly unified experience but also many new and amazing possibilities for both customers and partners. Whether you are a person belonging to the place willing to explore more or someone completely new to the city, Xplore Is for you!.
